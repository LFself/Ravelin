\title{\emph{Ravelin}: a C++ Robotics library for matrix/vector arithmetic and linear algebra}
\author{Dr. Evan Drumwright (http://robotics.gwu.edu/~drum/)}

\section{Motivation for creating this library: an alternative to Eigen}
- Eigen codes new implementations that have yet to stand the test of time
  our philosophy: \emph{A $< 1\%$ performance gain is not worth using
  code that has been fully vetted by time}
- Robotics code often just spits out numbers that are hard to debug
- integration with STL
